        ​​Did you know that Spain has the largest vineyard surface in the world?
        Is the second in production, behind Italy, This is due, in part, to the
        very low yields and wide spacing of the old vines planted on the dry,
        infertile soil found in some of the Spanish wine regions. This is even
        more impressive if you consider that the country is largely made up of
        old mountains. There are many hidden valleys that offer an enormous
        wealth of terroirs, where Spanish winegrowers mainly work with the
        typical old 'bush vines' to better protect the grapes. Talking about
        grapes, did you know that Spain has more than 70 autochthonous
        varieties? We believe that Spain is the country with the greatest wealth
        of terroirs for making wine, the strongest identity and, paradoxically,
        the most undervalued production. So our path started to be traced:
        UNCOVER THE HIDDEN VALUE OF SPANISH WINE. THE MISSION YOU JUST SIGNED
        FOR IS TO UNCOVER WHAT SPAIN HAS TO OFFER, BE CAREFUL: YOU HAVE 90 SECS
        TO COMPLETE THE MISSION.
